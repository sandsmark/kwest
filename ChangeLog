Version 0.9 (20010810) - first public release

  - Fairly complete Z-machine interpreter, based on Frotz 2.41, supporting
    colour, styles and timed input. Not yet supported are sound and V6 pictures.
  - Same input-editing facilities as Frotz: command history, tab completion.
  - Fonts and colors are changeable on the fly through the GUI.
  - If your KDE desktop is configured for anti-aliased fonts, Kwest will
    automatically take advantage of this for a crisp display.
