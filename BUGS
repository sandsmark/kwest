-Resizing the window or changing the font size while a game is in
 progress, can corrupt the display. Solving this requires reworking
 the way Kwest currently handles output.

-Kwest does currently not set a flag indicating it supports color.
 It gets set in the beginning of program, but then gets reset behind
 my back somewhere. I haven't been motivated enough to try and fix
 this, since most games that use color do not rely on the setting of
 this flag.

-Sometimes saving or restoring through the icons inserts and extra
 'y' or return at the next line.
